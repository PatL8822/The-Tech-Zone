## Description

For this project i was wanting to learn handlebars, mysql2 and sequelize. So i built this tech blog to help set the foundations of learning the daft structure file routing and setting the URL correctly. The biggest challenge for me was learning the process of CRUD Create, Read, Update/PUT and Delete. Being able to obtain the id was my biggest challenge.
